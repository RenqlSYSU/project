BUG FIX IN CODE 2012 6 MARCH, TIM CRONIN AND DAN CHAVAS
- FIXED OPTION FOR NON-INTERACTIVE WATER VAPOR IN RADIATION CODE: ORIGINAL VERSION SIMPLY FIXED WATER VAPOR CONSTANT FOR ALL TIME; NOW CODE ALLOWS WATER VAPOR TO VARY IN TIME, BUT RADIATION CODE USES STORED VECTOR OF THE INITIAL VERTICAL PROFILE OF WATER VAPOR.

Line 46:
	  REAL RT(NA), RV2(NA), RVFIX(NA) ! total water and water vapor (sb)
C
C 2012-03-06: twcronin and drchavas added variable RVFIX -- fixed mixing ratio 
C to be used in radiation scheme


Line 384:
         RVFIX(I)=R1(I)
C twc/drc - RVFIX initialized to R1 -- value from initial sounding


Line 788:
          RV2(I) = FRNETM*RV2(I)+(1-FRNETM)*RVFIX(I)
C
C twc/drc -- set mixing ratio called into radiation scheme -- RV2(I)
C    use prognostic mixing ratio (R2(I)-cloud water) if FRNETM=1 (H2OI='y')
C    or use the mixing ratio from the initial sounding (RVFIX) 
C    in the case that H2OI='n' and FRNETM=0


Line 1118:
C         R3(I)=R1(I)+2.*DT*FRNET(I)*FRNETM
C twc/drc fix to spuriously setting mixing ratio tendency to zero if water vapor not interactive
         R3(I)=R1(I)+2.*DT*FRNET(I)
